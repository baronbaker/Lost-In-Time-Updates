# Lost-In-Time-Updates
This is made to keep track of my ideas and current progress on my first personal project game. The current title is "Lost In Time" but it is a stand-in for now.

## Gameplay Notes

Basic Combat Elements:
	• Functions somewhat like Mercenary from Risk of Rain 2
	• Two different slashes with sword
		○ Different animations should be made for the same type of slash to improve fluidity
	• One slash should help move character upwards
	• Dash attack that functions similarly to kinetic blade in fortnite
	• Parry function with nice animation when parry timed correctly, bad animation when not
	• For certain scenarios, gun is available, replaces the dash with an ads to shoot
		○ You can throw the gun to regain movement but you will be able to pick it up again
		○ Thinking like imagine you shoot, throw the gun, dash to the gun, and then shoot again
	• Also maybe add two swords option
		○ Having two swords allows you to parry bullets
		○ Maybe the dash range would be lower though? I need to think of a caveat for this
	• Inventory:
		○ I want it to function similar to BOTW where time slows down while accessing the inventory so you can swap between your different swords/handguns
	• Movement:
		○ I want to make sure there is a constant conservation of momentum as I want this game to appeal to speedrunners as well
		○ You should be able to blaze through it if you know what you are doing, like placing the enemies in the right spot and whatnot
		○ There should be slide mechanics and the character should not glide across the ground unless using it
		
		
Swords and Guns:
	• Swords:
		○ Have one or two different swords placed around each scenario that have great affects against the enemies of that stage
		○ 
	• Guns:
		○ Basic handgun - like a glock or something, shouldn't shoot fast
		○ Sniper handgun - Decked out pistol that looks funny, shoots way slower but packs bigger punch
Flintknock ? - Just implement a gun that propels you in the opposite direction that you fired it in
